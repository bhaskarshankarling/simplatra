```

### Template structure

#### Models - `app/models`

To generate a new `ActiveRecord` model, use the following `rake` task:

```bash
# Generates a new model class file app/models/model_name.rb (parameters: NAME)
$ rake generate:model NAME=ModelName
```

#### Views - `app/views`

The `app/views` directory should contain all of the `HTML`/`ERB`-related view files of the application, including templates, partials etc.

#### Controllers - `app/controllers`

Multiple routes can be declared in a single controller file. However, you may have multiple controller files with their own routes.

The core application controller is named `application.rb`. It should contain routes which are core to the application, such as 404 routes and index routes.

To generate a new controller file, use the following `rake` task:

```bash
# Generates a new controller class file app/controllers/controller_name.rb (parameters: NAME)
$ rake generate:controller NAME=ControllerName
```

#### Helpers - `app/helpers`

Similarly to routes, multiple helper methods can be declared in a single helper file. But you can also have multiple helper files.

The core application helper file is named `application.rb`.

To generate a new helper file, use the following `rake` task:

```bash
# Generates a new helper class file app/helpers/helper_name.rb (parameters: NAME)
$ rake generate:helper NAME=HelperName
```

#### Static data - `app/yaml`

Static data can be stored in `YAML` files in the `app/yaml` directory. This works the same way as the static version of Simplatra. For more information [read here](https://github.com/simplatra/simplatra#yaml-data).

## Installation

To to prepare this template for usage in your application:

```bash
# Clone into the repository
$ git clone https://github.com/simplatra/simplatra-mvc.git

# Change directory and install dependencies
$ cd simplatra-mvc && bundle install

# Set up the application
$ rake setup NAME=your-app-name && cd .
```

Alternatively for the last step, if you want to recursively delete all `.gitkeep` files in the application subdirectories:

```bash
# Sets up the application and recursively deletes all .gitkeep files
$ rake setup NAME=your-app-name GITKEEP=true && cd .
```

In this template, the `.gitkeep` files serve no purpose other than to preserve folder structure and empty folders in the Git repository.

## Running the application

To run the application, simply use:

```bash
$ rackup
```

All files located within directories of the asset pipeline are constantly being watched, and will update without having to restart the server with `rackup` again.

## Demonstration

[View the demo application here](https://github.com/simplatra/simplatra-mvc-demo).

This demo only showcases new MVC features which were not present in Simplatra such as models and database migrations & configuration. For a general demo on Simplatra, [click here](https://github.com/simplatra/simplatra-demo).

## Deployment

Simplatra MVC is bundled and set up to be deployed on Heroku, so this would probably be the easiest way to deploy your application. Although this README won't explain other methods of deployment, feel free to deploy however you like!

### Deploying to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)

If you plan to deploy your Sinatra application with Heroku, there is already a `Procfile` included with the following process type:

```
web: bundle exec rackup config.ru -p $PORT
```

#### Buildpack

You will need to use the `heroku/ruby` buildpack.

This should be automatically be set when you make your first deployment. If not, this can be changed in your application's Heroku settings.

#### Environment variables

Ensure that you set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable in your Heroku settings if you don't wish to use the default database given by Heroku.

## Performance monitoring with [New Relic RPM](https://github.com/newrelic/rpm) and Heroku

New Relic RPM can be used for monitoring the performance of your application once deployed. Heroku has an add-on for New Relic RPM with free and paid plans. To use New Relic RPM:

1. Configure your New Relic settings in the configuration file `config/newrelic.yml` of your application. For more information on configuring the `newrelic.yml` file, [read this document](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/ruby-agent/configuration/ruby-agent-configuration)
2. Deploy your application as normal on Heroku
3. Open the application page of your newly-made application from your [Heroku dashboard](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps)
4. Search for the `New Relic APM` add-on, select a plan and add it to your app
5. Set the `NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY` environment variable in your Heroku application settings to your license key (if it isn't already set)

Additionally, you can set up regular pinging for your Heroku application. If your application runs on [free dynos](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/free-dyno-hours#quota), ensure that New Relic isn't eating up your free dyno hours quota. You can alter the ping rate for your application in the settings on the New Relic website.

1. Go to your application's page on the New Relic website.
2. On the sidebar on the left, under the `Reports` section, select `Availability`.
3. In the URL text-box, enter the URL of your Heroku application (e.g. http://appname.herokuapp.com). Continue to the next screen and don't change any settings (unless you know what you're doing)!

## Compatibility and testing

This template (along with the [demo](https://github.com/simplatra/simplatra-mvc-demo) application) has been tested on:

- macOS Sierra (Version 10.12.6)
- Linux Debian 9

However, there shouldn't be any reason for this to not work on other UNIX systems, and versions of different Linux distributions or other OSX versions.

It may or may not require a bit of work to get this template working correctly on Windows.
